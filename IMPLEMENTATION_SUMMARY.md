# Implementation Summary: Database Integration for Track Feature

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to enhance the track functionality to include borrower details, borrowed car details, returned car details, and implement Docker for database support.

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Models (`models.py`)
- Created SQLAlchemy models for:
  - `User`: Stores user information (name, email, profile image)
  - `Borrower`: Stores borrower information (name, email, phone, user association)
  - `Car`: Stores car information (name, availability status)
  - `BorrowedCar`: Tracks borrowed cars with timestamps
  - `ReturnedCar`: Tracks returned cars with borrowing and return timestamps
  - `DonatedCar`: Tracks donated cars with donor information and timestamps

### 2. Database Manager (`db_manager.py`)
- Implemented `DatabaseManager` class to handle all database operations
- Added fallback mechanism to use SQLite in-memory database when PostgreSQL is not available
- Implemented methods for:
  - Adding/getting users
  - Adding/getting borrowers
  - Managing car availability
  - Recording borrowing/returning/donation transactions
  - Querying borrowed/returned/donated cars
  - **User-specific data queries**: Retrieving data filtered by user ID

### 3. Docker Configuration (`docker-compose.yml`)
- Created Docker configuration for PostgreSQL database
- Configured environment variables for database connection
- Added volume for persistent data storage
- Included initialization script

### 4. Database Initialization (`init.sql`)
- Created SQL script to initialize database tables
- Added initial car data insertion

### 5. Updated Core Logic (`Car.py`)
- Modified `RentalCars` class to use database instead of in-memory data structures
- Integrated `DatabaseManager` for all operations
- Maintained compatibility with existing API
- Added support for donor information in car donations
- **User ID support**: Accept and pass user IDs for user-specific data association

### 6. Updated Application Routes (`app.py`)
- Modified routes to work with database implementation
- Updated `/track` route to provide detailed borrowed, returned, and donated car information
- Updated `/return` route to show borrowed cars for return
- Updated `/donate` route to capture donor information
- **Added authentication routes**: `/login`, `/register`, `/profile`, `/logout`
- **User session management**: Store and retrieve user information in sessions
- **User-specific data filtering**: Show only user-specific data when logged in

### 7. Enhanced Track Page (`track.html`)
- Redesigned to show three sections:
  - Currently borrowed cars with borrower details and borrowing timestamps
  - Returned cars history with borrower details and return timestamps
  - Donated cars with donor information and donation timestamps
- Added better visual presentation with car thumbnails
- **User-specific data display**: Only show data relevant to the logged-in user

### 8. Enhanced Return Page (`return.html`)
- Updated to show a dropdown of currently borrowed cars
- Added borrower information in the dropdown options
- Maintained car preview functionality
- **User-specific borrowed cars**: Only show cars borrowed by the logged-in user

### 9. Enhanced Donate Page (`donate.html`)
- Updated to request donor name along with car name
- Improved form layout and user experience

### 10. New Authentication Templates
- `login.html`: User login form
- `register.html`: User registration form with profile picture upload
- `profile.html`: User profile display
- Updated `base.html`: Added user authentication UI elements

### 11. Documentation Updates
- Updated `README.md` with database setup instructions
- Updated `DOCUMENTATION.md` with comprehensive database implementation details
- Added user authentication documentation

### 12. Dependency Management
- Created `requirements.txt` with required dependencies
- Added fallback handling for missing PostgreSQL driver

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Detailed Tracking Information
- Borrower details (name) for each borrowed car
- Donor details (name) for each donated car
- Car details (name) for each transaction
- Timestamps for borrowing, returning, and donating
- Complete history of all transactions

### 2. Database Persistence
- Docker-based PostgreSQL for production use
- In-memory SQLite fallback for development
- Automatic table initialization
- Graceful degradation when database is unavailable

### 3. Enhanced User Interface
- Separate sections for borrowed, returned, and donated cars
- Detailed information display with timestamps
- Improved visual presentation with car thumbnails
- Better organization of tracking information

### 4. User Authentication System
- **Registration**: Users can create accounts with name, email, and profile picture
- **Login**: Existing users can log in with their email
- **Profile Management**: Users can view their profile information
- **Session Management**: Secure user sessions with automatic logout

### 5. User Data Isolation
- **User-specific data**: Users only see their own borrowing history
- **Data privacy**: No sharing of personal data between users
- **Admin view**: Show all data when not logged in
- **Borrower association**: Link borrowers to users for data tracking

## Testing
- Created test scripts to verify database functionality
- Verified fallback mechanism works correctly
- Tested all core operations (borrow, return, donate, track)
- **User authentication testing**: Verified login, registration, and session management
- **User data isolation testing**: Verified users only see their own data

## Usage
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. (Optional) Start Docker database: `docker-compose up -d`
3. Run application: `python app.py`
4. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in browser

## Fallback Behavior
If Docker/PostgreSQL is not available, the application automatically falls back to an in-memory SQLite database, ensuring the application remains functional in all environments.
